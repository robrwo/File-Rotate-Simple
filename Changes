  [Enhancements]
  - Added optional export "rotate_files" to provide a functional interface.

  - Added "start_num" attribute for specifying the starting number.

  - Added the "if_missing" attribute to rotate if the file is missing.
    (Enabled by default for backwards compatability.)

  - Added "touch" attribute to touch the file after rotating.

  - The file rotation algorithm has been completely rewritten to be more
    flexible in naming.

    The processing order of files is sorted by dependency order
    (e.g. "foo.2" is renamed to "foo.3" before "foo.1" is renamed to
    "foo.2"), so as to allow more kinds of file rotation schemes.
